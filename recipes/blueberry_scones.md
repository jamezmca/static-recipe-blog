# Blueberry Scones

## Ingredients

- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup (75g) granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons (85g) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- 3/4 cup (180ml) heavy cream, plus extra for brushing
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup (150g) fresh or frozen blueberries

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Whisk together** flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.

3. **Cut in** the butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

4. **Whisk together** heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract in a small bowl.

5. **Add** the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Gently fold in the blueberries.

6. **Turn out** the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently a few times. Pat the dough into a round disc, about 1 inch thick.

7. **Cut** the disc into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them apart.

8. **Brush** the tops of the scones with a little extra cream.

9. **Bake** for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.

10. **Cool** on a wire rack before serving.

Enjoy your homemade blueberry scones!
