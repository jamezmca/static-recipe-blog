# Classic Apple Pie

## Ingredients

### Pie Crust
- 2 1/2 cups (315g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, chilled and diced
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60-120ml) ice water

### Filling
- 6 to 8 large apples, peeled, cored, and sliced (about 8 cups)
- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Egg Wash
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the pie crust:** In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, stirring until the dough comes together. Divide dough in half, shape into discs, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

2. **Preheat oven** to 425°F (220°C).

3. **Make the filling:** In a large bowl, mix sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon juice.

4. **Assemble the pie:** Roll out one dough disc on a floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Transfer to pie plate and trim the edges. Fill with apple mixture and dot with butter. Roll out the second dough disc and place it over the filling. Trim, seal, and flute the edges. Cut slits in the top crust for steam to escape.

5. **Apply egg wash:** Mix the beaten egg with water and brush over the top crust.

6. **Bake:** Bake for 15 minutes at 425°F (220°C). Reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly.

7. **Cool:** Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack before serving.
